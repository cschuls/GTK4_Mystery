This set of files contain a workaround for the apparent quirk in how GTK4 only seems to allow CSS customization
for certain widgets at the display level.  The "progressbar.ui" was revised to include and "id" property which
makes each progress bar widget unique.  Then the "main.c" program was revised to have the singular CSS provider
definition include all of the needed style information for both progress bar widgets.
